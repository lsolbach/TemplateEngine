Template Engine
===============

The soulspace.org TemplateEngine is a template engine written in Java
(as you might have guessed). It consists of a template language and an
engine for processing the language and transforming and emitting texts.

Features:
---------
* general purpose template engine
* syntax is easy to learn
* simple things are easy, complex things are possible
* data binding for java beans (use bean objects as input) and xml files
* view language, safe by design, no modification of input java objects possible
	(if getters on objects have no side effects, which is bad design anyway)
* string, numeric, list, map and method datatypes
* arithmetic, relational and logical operators
* branching with if/else, while loops and foreach loops with filters
* declaration of variables and methods within the templates
* full recursion and overriding support for methods
* functional programming support
	* methods as first class citizens
	* closures
	* higher order methods
	* methods as return value (function builders)
* extensible library of type methods (e.g. s.split(';') or s.toLower() on strings)

Runtime Requirements:
---------------------
Jakarta ORO >= 2.0.8 (could be refactored to use standard Java RegEx,
then there would be no external dependencies anymore. Volunteers?)
